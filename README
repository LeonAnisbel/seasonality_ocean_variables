The scripts in this project computes the seasonality of ocean variables (e.g. biomolecules, phytoplankton concentration
and SIC) and Organic mass fraction from marine biomolecules.
Biomolecules (DCAA and PL) were computed based on FESOM-REcoM tracers. See more information in Leon-Marcos et al. 2025

- Customize the desire experiments (e.g. regions to select) and directories to the data in global_vars.py file
- Run Seasonality_regions.py to compute the multiannual monthly mean of all variables
- Run plot_figures.py to create all figures (information of the figures that are created is provided in this file)
